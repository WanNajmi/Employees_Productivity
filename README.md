## Context
The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive 
industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production
and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers
in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories

## Content
This dataset includes important attributes of the garment manufacturing process and the productivity of the 
employees which had been collected manually and also been validated by the industry experts.
